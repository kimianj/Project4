            <h2><strong>An island paradise resort where you can experience the Maldives to its fullest</strong></h2>
            <p>
                The Maldives is one of those places that continue to pop up on travellers' 
                bucket lists. And for a very good reason. If you've fantasized about living a-lavish-Robinson Crusoe life on a faraway tropical island, 
                you're in the right place. At LUX* South Ari Atoll, you will ride your bicycle along the jetty, swim alongside whale sharks, 
                hang out in your bungalow on stilts, dine at any of the eight restaurants, dance the night away, partake in marine conservation… 
                Whatever it is you love, you'll find it here at LUX* Sout.</p>
                
                <p>LUX* Resorts & Hotels helps people to celebrate life by delivering consistently 
                on the promise of a different kind of Luxury; hospitality that is Lighter.Brighter. LUX* stages exceptional experiences in different locales
                whether on the Beach, in the City or in Nature by banishing thoughtless patterns and being more simple, fresh and sensory than our competitors.
                At LUX*, every moment matters; we've banished thoughtless patterns and created simple, fresh and sensory experiences to indulge our guests 
                throughout their stay with us.</p>
                
                <p>From freshly, locally roasted and ethically sourced coffee, retro-style ice cream parlours and tailor made health and spa sessions 
                to magical tree of wishes, junk art galleries and impromptu on-the-beach film screenings, each LUX* experience is designed to help 
                our guests celebrate life by turning the ordinary into extraordinary…</p>
